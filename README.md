# obsidian-friendly-theme
Nice dark mode theme I scrapped together.

Using fonts: JetBrains Mono, iA Writer Quattro V, Petrona, Ranille, Harlow Solid.

HIGHLY recommended using either the Tabs plugin or Sliding Panes. It has a bunch of CSS for those and some other plugins.

## to-do
- [ ] fix tabs top margin bug (please someone help)
