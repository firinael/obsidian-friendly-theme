# obsidian-friendly-theme

This ain't too fancy since I don't have the time or skill for much, but it does what you'd expect and works well enough.

Custom support:
- ITS-like asides, image captioning and positioning (no callouts because I don't understand them yet);
- Kanban plugin;
- Page-breaking on print with double line-break (`---` in two consecutive lines);
- Quick Explorer plugin;
- cMenu plugin;
- Alternative table styling (`excel` or `excelite` class in frontmatter);
- Center and cite styling (`<b class=cen>centered text</b>` or `<b class=cit>source</b>`);
- Calendar plugin;
- Clean and join note embeds (`clean-embeds` in frontmatter);
- LanguageTool plugin; 

Using fonts: JetBrains Mono, iA Writer Quattro, Ranille, and Harlow.

HIGHLY recommended using either the **Tabs plugin** or Sliding Panes. It has a bunch of CSS for those.

## to-do
- [ ] fix tabs top margin bug (please someone help)
- [ ] add gradient to top of pane (also need help)
